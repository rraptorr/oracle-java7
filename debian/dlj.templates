     someone not under your direction or control, and you were in
     compliance with all other terms of this Agreement.  If the Software
     README file permits certain files to be replaced or omitted from
     your distribution, then any such replacement(s) or omission(s)

     or authorize your licensees, distributors, resellers, OEMs, or end

     behavior of, classes, interfaces, or subpackages that are in any
     way identified as "java", "javax", "sun" or similar convention as
     specified by Sun in any naming convention designation. You
     acknowledge that Licensed Software is not designed or intended for
     use in the design, construction, operation or maintenance of any
     nuclear facility. Sun Microsystems, Inc. disclaims any express or
     implied warranty of fitness for such uses.

 4.  COMPATIBILITY.  If you exercise the license in Section 2, and Sun
     or a licensee of the Software (under section 4(b)) notifies you
     that there are compatibility issues (as determined by the
     applicable Technology Compatibility Kit) caused by the interaction
     of the Software with your Operating System, then within ninety
     (90) days you must either: (a) modify the Operating System in a
     way that resolves the compatibility issue (as determined by Sun)
     and make a patch or replacement version available to your
     Licensees who have already received the version of your Operating
     System that was the subject of the compatibility issue ("Your
     Incompatible Operating System"); or (b) cease distributing the
     Software and make commercially reasonable attempts to forward the
     notification to your Licensees who have already received Your
     Incompatible Operating System.

     or its authorized resellers, Sun warrants to you that for a period
     of ninety (90) days from delivery to you, the media on which
     Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects in
     materials and workmanship under normal use.  Except for the
     foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".  Your exclusive remedy
     and Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be

     EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES,

 8.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE
     LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR
     PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS

     BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will
     Sun's liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including
     negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for the
     Software under this Agreement. The foregoing limitations will
     apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its essential
     purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental or
     consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be
     applicable to you.
 .
 9.  THIRD PARTY CODE. Additional copyright notices and license terms
     applicable to portions of the Software are set forth in the
     THIRDPARTYLICENSEREADME.txt file. In addition to any terms and

     identified in the THIRDPARTYLICENSEREADME.txt file, the disclaimer
     of warranty and limitation of liability provisions in paragraphs 7
     and 8 of this Agreement shall apply to all Software in this
     distribution.
 .
 10. Termination.  This Agreement is effective until it is
     terminated. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by
     ceasing distribution of the Software. This Agreement will
     terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you fail to
     comply with any material provision herein.  Either party may
     terminate this Agreement immediately should any Software become,
     or in either party's opinion be likely to become, the subject of a
     claim of infringement of any intellectual property right.  Upon
     termination, you must destroy all copies and cease copying and
     distribution of the Software. All of your obligations and any
     applicable limitations on your rights and remedies under this
     Agreement shall survive termination.
 .
 11. SOURCE CODE.  Software may contain source code that, unless
     expressly licensed for other purposes, is provided solely for
     reference purposes pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
     Source code may not be redistributed unless expressly provided for
     in this Agreement.
 .
 12. Export Regulations. All Software and technical data delivered
     under this Agreement are subject to US export control laws and may
     be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.
     You acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain such
     licenses to export, re-export, or import as may be required after
     delivery to you.
 .
 13. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS.  If Software is being acquired
     by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government
     prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), then the
     Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation
     will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance
     with 48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense
     (DOD) acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD
     acquisitions).
 .
 14. MISCELLANEOUS.  Any action related to this Agreement will be
     governed by California law and controlling U.S. federal law.  No
     choice of law rules of any jurisdiction will apply. If any
     provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this
     Agreement will remain in effect upon the parties' agreement to
     revised terms that most nearly accomplish the same effect. This
     Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to
     its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
     oral or written communications, proposals, representations and
     warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms
     of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other communication
     between the parties relating to its subject matter during the term
     of this Agreement.  No modification of this Agreement will be
     binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized
     representative of each party.
