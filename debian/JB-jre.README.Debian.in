Compatibility and problems with some window managers
====================================================

Some window mangers have problems running java programs with the environment
variable AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit. For these cases, please use a window manger
which doesn't show these problems.

For details, please see http://bugs.debian.org/504524


Installation of extensions:
===========================
* Extensions which work with all Java 2 VMs (>= v1.3) should be installed
  in /@basedir@/ext (with native libraries in /@basedir@/<ARCH>).
  Packages should depend on @JRE@ or @JDK@ if development tools are required.
* Extension which require a specific Java @RELEASE@ version should be installed
  in /@basedir@/jre/lib/ext (with native libraries 
  in /@basedir@/jre/lib/<ARCH>).
  Packages should depend on @JRE@ or @JDK@ if
  development tools are required.
(<ARCH> currently is 'i386' for all x86 machines, 'sparc' for all sparc
machines, and '`uname -m`' for all other machines)


Debian Java Repository:
=======================
/usr/share/java/repository gets added to CLASSPATH automatically but
it is not an extension directory. If you want to give all permissions
to code installed in /usr/share/java/repository, the uncomment the
corresponding section in /etc/@basename@/security/java.policy.


Alternatives:
=============
Please see README.alternatives.


Java Plug-In (i386 only):
=========================
* The @basename@-plugin package automatically enables the Java Plug-In
  for use with Firefox, Mozilla, and browsers based on Mozilla.
* The Plug-In can be configured with the program ControlPanel.
* Netscape 4.x only:  For versions < 4.77 the Plug-In only works for
  HTML pages which have been modified for use with the Plug-In.
  Since version 4.77 it is possible to completely replace Netscape's
  builtin VM: Enable 'Edit->Preferences->Advanced->Enable Java->Enable
  Java Plugin'


Java WebStart support:
======================
Support for Java(TM) Web Start Technology is included in this
package but must be enabled on a per-user basis.  See
/usr/share/@basename@/javaws-1_2-linux-int.zip for more information.


Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) support:
==========================================
For legal resaon, JCE support in this environment is limited to
smaller key sizes.  Please see
<URL:http://javashoplm.sun.com/ECom/docs/Welcome.jsp?StoreId=22&PartDetailId=7503-jce-1.4.2-oth-JPR&SiteId=JSC&TransactionId=noreg>
for the Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files.

Additional security issues:
===========================
With release 1.4.1,
/@basedir@/jre/lib/security/cacerts is now
/etc/@basename@/security/cacerts as is treated as a
configuration file by dpkg.  This means that changes to this file are
preserved across package update.  You should, therefore, think about
changing the default password protecting this file.

You should also consider changing
/etc/@basename@/security/java.policy to prevent threads from
calling java.lang.Thread.stop() without any arguments.  This feature
is enabled by default in the interests of backward compatibility but
may result in security issues.  You will find more details on this in
java.policy.
