Compatibility and problems with some window managers
====================================================

Some window mangers have problems running java programs with the environment
variable AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit. For these cases, please use a window manger
which doesn't show these problems.

For details, please see http://bugs.debian.org/504524


Installation of extensions:
===========================
* Extensions which work with all Java 2 VMs (>= v1.3) should be installed
  in /@basedir@/ext (with native libraries in /@basedir@/<ARCH>).
  Packages should depend on @JRE@ or @JDK@ if development tools are required.
* Extension which require a specific Java @RELEASE@ version should be installed
  in /@basedir@/jre/lib/ext (with native libraries 
  in /@basedir@/jre/lib/<ARCH>).
  Packages should depend on @JRE@ or @JDK@ if
  development tools are required.


Debian Java Repository:
=======================
/usr/share/java/repository gets added to CLASSPATH automatically but
it is not an extension directory. If you want to give all permissions
to code installed in /usr/share/java/repository, the uncomment the
corresponding section in /etc/@basename@/security/java.policy.


Alternatives:
=============
Please see README.alternatives.


Java Plug-In:
=========================
* The @basename@-plugin package automatically enables the Java Plug-In
  for use with Firefox, Mozilla, and browsers based on Mozilla.
* The Plug-In can be configured with the program ControlPanel.
* Make sure you have Java enabled in Iceweasel's preferences dialog.



Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) support:
==========================================
JCE unlimited strength jurisdiction policy files are now included by default,
older versions of this package recommended to use dpkg-divert before replacing
installed files to avoid upgrade problems, you can keep those diverted files
or revert to use the included files:

  sudo dpkg-divert --rename --remove /@basedir@/jre/lib/security/local_policy.jar
  sudo dpkg-divert --rename --remove /@basedir@/jre/lib/security/US_export_policy.jar

Additional security issues:
===========================
/@basedir@/jre/lib/security/cacerts is a symlink to
/etc/@basename@/security/cacerts and treated as a
configuration file by dpkg.  This means that changes to this file are
preserved across package update.  You should, therefore, think about
changing the default password protecting this file.

You should also consider changing
/etc/@basename@/security/java.policy to prevent threads from
calling java.lang.Thread.stop() without any arguments.  This feature
is enabled by default in the interests of backward compatibility but
may result in security issues.  You will find more details on this in
java.policy.
