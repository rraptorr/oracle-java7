1. Introduction

Due to licensing problems Java 6 was recently removed from Debian
testing and Debian stable/oldstable was stuck with Java 6u26. Given
security updates in later Java versions, this is leaves no choice, but
manual Java update (OpenJDK not being an alternative for many).

I didn't like the idea of installing Java by hand on my Debian
systems, so I've looked for updated Java packages. As I was unable to
find ones, I've decided to make my own, so I've pulled latest package
sources from the Debian Subversion repository and adapted it to the
latest Java 6.

2. Supported Debian versions

So far packages were tested on following Debian versions:
- wheezy i386/amd64
- squeeze i386/amd64
- lenny i386/amd64

Packages are compatible with "official" Debian ones. I've only adapted
them to the newest Java 6 and I've removed licensing stuff (since it
does not apply anymore) and some obsolete code from rules. For details
of changes see 'changelog' file.

3. Usage

To create packages on your own:
- apt-get install dpkg-dev
- git clone git://github.com/rraptorr/sun-java6.git sun-java6-6.30
- cd sun-java6-6.30
- Download jdk-6u30-linux-i586.bin and jdk-6u30-linux-x64.bin from
  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
  (yes, both, no matter which version you will run)
- dpkg-buildpackage -b
- install any missing packages that dpkg-buildpackage complains about
  and repeat
